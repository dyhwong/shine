Milestone 1

###User research

*What problem does your application address, and how does your application 
address it?*

>We wanted to go with the fitness theme, so we're creating a website that revolves 
around a fitness game. The idea is that if working out is fun, more people will do it! 

*What are the killer features of your application?*
> The website centers around a rhythm-motion game that uses webcam feed to guide
users to do various motions. Hopefully, we can allow users to customize to their 
music taste, where other users are playing from, and personal/global high scores.

*Identify and briefly describe your target demographic. Who do you envision using 
your site?*
> The graphics and interface will be directed towards the young adult population (i.e. 
no cartoon characters, more sleek, modern look). However, the content will be 
family-friendly so people of all ages who want to get more fit can play.

###Use Case
####Playing a Game

> * User inputs login username and password
* System recalls information with that combination
* User clicks play
* System prompts for calibration
* User follows instructions
* (x)System calibrates, loads game using calibrated settings
* User plays the game
* System saves score to username, prompts to save score globally
* User chooses to submit or discard score globally
* System saves score globally based on option chosen, prompts to restart the game 
from (x)

####Mockups

> * Draft 1 - pros: flexible UI, clear layout, effective use of negative space; cons: crowded navigation bar, distracts from gaming environment, not enough contrast
* Draft 2 - pros: tight configuration, centralized design, focus on the game; cons: too much focus on music icon, not immediate understandable layout, cluttered when opening menus
* Draft 3 - pros: logo is prominent, effective use of negative space, focus on game; cons: navigation bar can get messy, not easy to find help, commands spaced too far apart (x)

###MVP

*1. What features do you plan to implement? How critical are they 
to the proper functioning of your application?*
> Login validation, logo design, site navigation, database retrieval, and 
game and webcam mechanics will be implemented. This will 
give our website an initial design and framework for further 
improvements.

*2. What features do you plan to leave out? How critical are they 
to the proper functioning of your application?*

> Security and friendly user interface will be left for later, as 
they are not essential to the core functioning of the website.

*3. Are there any other aspects of your application that are 
reduced in your MVP? Examples including limited fake datasets, 
stylistic concerns, security concerns, etc.*

> Security considerations, graphics, and user interface will be 
reduced in MVP.

###Additional Questions

*1. Who is in your team? You may list at most 3 people (4 if you 
are not competing in the main division). For each member list the 
full legal name, .edu e-mail, school, major(s), year, and 
graduate/undergraduate status. For each team member, also 
indicate whether they are registered to take the class for credit.*

*2. Which of the themes does your application match best? Be as 
brief as you can.*
> Physical Activity and Fitness

*3. What technology do you plan to use for your server-side 
programming (e.g. PHP, Ruby on Rails, etc)?*
> Mongo DB and Node.js
